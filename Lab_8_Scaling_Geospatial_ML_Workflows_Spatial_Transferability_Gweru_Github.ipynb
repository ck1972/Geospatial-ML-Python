        "First, the Sentinel-2 and PALSAR HV bands are stacked together using np.concatenate. The Sentinel-2 image contains nine spectral bands, and the PALSAR HV band is added as the tenth band by expanding its dimensions with np.newaxis, resulting in a three-dimensional array of shape (10, height, width). This array is then transposed to the shape (height, width, 10) to match the format expected by scikit-learn models, where each pixel is represented by a vector of 10 features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the stacked image is reshaped into a two-dimensional array (flat_pixels) of shape (number_of_pixels, 10) so that each row corresponds to a single pixel's feature vector. This reshaped array is passed to the predict method of the previously trained randomforest classifier (rf.predict(flat_pixels)), which outputs a flat array of predicted land cover class labels. Finally, the predictions are reshaped back to the original spatial dimensions (height, width) to produce a classified land cover map (predicted_image) suitable for visualization and export."
