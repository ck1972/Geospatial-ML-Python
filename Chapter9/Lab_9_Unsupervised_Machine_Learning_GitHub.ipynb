It also accounts for cluster shapes, orientations, and variances, making it more flexible for modeling real-world data distributions.\n",

These labels are stored in a 1D array (gmm_labels) and then mapped back to their corresponding pixel positions using the valid_mask. The final map (gmm_map) is reshaped into the original image dimensions (height × width), producing a spatially explicit land cover classification map based on GMM clustering."
